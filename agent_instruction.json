        "overview": "The CV2 Visualization Plugin provides a flexible and extensible framework for creating graphical user interfaces using OpenCV. It is built around the concept of `GuiComponent`, a base class for all visual elements. The plugin allows for hierarchical composition of components, enabling complex layouts. The core idea is to create a tree of components, where each component is responsible for drawing itself and its children.",
        "key_features": [
            "Hierarchical component structure: Components can be nested within each other to create complex UIs.",
            "Extensible: New UI elements can be created by subclassing `GuiComponent` and implementing the `draw` method.",
            "Relative and absolute positioning: Components are positioned relative to their parent, but can calculate their absolute position on the screen.",
            "Automatic rendering pipeline: The `render` method handles the drawing of the entire component tree."
        ]

    "warning": {
        "implement_draw_method": "When creating a new `GuiComponent`, you must implement the `draw` method. This method is responsible for creating the visual representation of the component on its `self.canvas`.",
        "performance_considerations": "Complex UIs with many components can impact performance. For real-time applications, optimize the `draw` methods of your components to be as efficient as possible."
